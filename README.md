# shotgun-query-field-test
A test to obtain the value of query fields in Shotgun/ShotGrid/Flow and display the result in a HTML table.

## Development

For development, I recommend a virtual environment by running the following command:

```commandline
python -m venv venv
```

Next we'll need to activate the environment in your current shell by running the following:

```commandline
Windows: venv/Scripts/activate.bat
MacOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
```

Lastly, we will install this package (and its dependencies) to the virtual environment:

```commandline
python -m pip install .
```
